The strike killed two people including one of the official's sons, the group and Syrian state media said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description>

      <title>Saudi Arabia Gives First Permanent Residencies to Foreigners</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/saudi-arabia-gives-first-permanent-111758066.html"&gt;&lt;img src="" width="130" height="86" alt="Saudi Arabia Gives First Permanent Residencies to Foreigners" align="left" title="Saudi Arabia Gives First Permanent Residencies to Foreigners" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia granted 73 foreigners “premium” residency under a new program to attract overseas investment by enabling selected people to buy property and do business without a Saudi sponsor.The kingdom received thousands of applications after offering permanent residency for 800,000 riyals ($213,000) or a one-year renewable permit for 100,000 riyals. The first batch of recipients come from 19 countries and include investors, doctors, engineers and financiers, according to a statement Monday from the government’s Premium Residency Center. It didn’t detail how many were granted permanent residency.The program, approved in May, is the latest sign of how the kingdom is rethinking the role for foreigners as it works to reduce the economy’s dependence on oil. It’s a landmark move in a region where many overseas workers are subject to some of the world’s most restrictive residency rules. The premium residencies also allow holders to switch jobs, exit the kingdom easily and sponsor visas for family members.The idea for a long-term Saudi residency was first floated in 2016 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. At the time, he estimated the program would generate about $10 billion in annual revenue by 2020.While Saudi Arabia is seeking to encourage the affluent to stay, monthly fees imposed on foreign workers and their families, along with sluggish economic growth, have prompted hundreds of thousands of other expats to leave. Those levies are designed to spur private businesses to hire Saudi nationals as citizen unemployment hovers above 12%.To contact the reporter on this story: Vivian Nereim in Riyadh at vnereim@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alaa Shahine at asalha@bloomberg.net, Mark Williams, Paul AbelskyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description>

The first batch of recipients come from 19 countries and include investors, doctors, engineers and financiers, according to a statement Monday from the government’s Premium Residency Center. It didn’t detail how many were granted permanent residency.The program, approved in May, is the latest sign of how the kingdom is rethinking the role for foreigners as it works to reduce the economy’s dependence on oil. It’s a landmark move in a region where many overseas workers are subject to some of the world’s most restrictive residency rules. The premium residencies also allow holders to switch jobs, exit the kingdom easily and sponsor visas for family members.The idea for a long-term Saudi residency was first floated in 2016 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. At the time, he estimated the program would generate about $10 billion in annual revenue by 2020.While Saudi Arabia is seeking to encourage the affluent to stay, monthly fees imposed on foreign workers and their families, along with sluggish economic growth, have prompted hundreds of thousands of other expats to leave. Those levies are designed to spur private businesses to hire Saudi nationals as citizen unemployment hovers above 12%.To contact the reporter on this story: Vivian Nereim in Riyadh at vnereim@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alaa Shahine at asalha@bloomberg.net, Mark Williams, Paul AbelskyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</media:text>

      <title>South Korea President’s Biggest Headache Is Prosecutor He Picked</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/south-korea-president-biggest-headache-210000792.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CdRkO08gIdStnU6UBvgVeA--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/af0a72fccaca0f978159da9a534cc6c3" width="130" height="86" alt="South Korea President’s Biggest Headache Is Prosecutor He Picked" align="left" title="South Korea President’s Biggest Headache Is Prosecutor He Picked" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;(Bloomberg) -- South Korean President Moon Jae-in -- swept into office on a vow to clean up government after his predecessor was ousted for graft -- wanted a prosecutor who wouldn’t hesitate to go after the most powerful.Problem is, Moon may have gotten what he wished for in Yoon Seok-youl.Almost immediately after being appointed as the nation’s chief prosecutor in July, Yoon launched a series of probes that have rocked Moon’s two-year-old administration. The scandal has forced one justice minister to resign and helped push Moon’s approval rating to a record low -- just as he girds for an April parliamentary election that will shape the second half of his term.The investigations are only the latest in string of high-profile cases brought by Yoon, 58, over the years, including probes of two former presidents, a chief justice and the heads of Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. After then-President Park Geun-hye demoted Yoon, he joined the special prosecutor’s team whose findings laid the groundwork for her impeachment and removal.“I’m not loyal to anyone,” he famously told lawmakers when asked about one such probe in 2013.Adding to the intrigue is the fact that Yoon’s latest case involves a man whom Moon once predicted would make a “fantastic duo” with the chief prosecutor: Former Justice Minster Cho Kuk. Last month, Cho was forced to resign after just five weeks on the job amid investigations into whether members of his family inflated college admission applications and improperly benefited from investments in a private equity fund.While Cho has denied wrongdoing and hasn’t been accused of any crimes, his wife and nephew have been indicted on various charges while his brother has been detained for questioning. Any expansion of Yoon’s probe to implicate him personally would pose problems for Moon, who decided to force through Cho’s appointment even after the investigations began. “I don’t know what allegations I’ll be charged with but it seems like the indictment against me has already been planned,” Cho wrote on his Facebook page late Monday.“Moon’s presidency was empowered by high public expectations for clean government,” said Park Sung-min, head of MIN Consulting, a political consulting firm in Seoul. If Cho “faces additional allegations related to his duty as part of the prosecutor’s probe into his family, Moon and the ruling party will receive a megablow,” he said.The investigations add a new worry for Moon on top of a slowing economy and a North Korean regime that has mocked his efforts to play a mediating role in nuclear talks with the U.S. The opposition Liberty Korea Party has drawn almost even with the ruling Democratic Party in some polls, raising the prospect that it could gain control of the National Assembly in April and stymie Moon’s agenda.Moon’s office declined to comment Monday, referring to remarks he made in Yoon’s presence Friday praising the prosecutor’s progress toward “political neutrality.” Moon said it was important to establish a fair anti-corruption system that could endure after “Yoon leaves office and regardless of who replaces him.”When announcing Yoon’s appointment, Moon praised him as “a man of integrity who’s not swayed by pressure from power.” Still, the Yonhap News Agency quoted a Moon administration official in September as saying that the investigation was on a scale that would only be necessary for “probing a conspiracy of a rebellion or completely mopping up the mafia.”The Supreme Prosecutors’ Office declined a request for comment. When asked about the investigation during a parliamentary hearing last month, Yoon vowed to follow the facts: “We prosecutors are not swayed by circumstances. We process the case only in accordance with principles and that’s what we’ll continue to do.”Yoon’s reputation for challenging authority goes back at least to his time in law school when he was forced to flee Seoul after participating in a mock trial in which he sought the death penalty against former coup-leader-turned-president Chun Doo-hwan. Back then, Yoon was known for belting out “Ave Maria” and “American Pie” in karaoke sessions, according to a person who has known him for more than 40 years.Yoon became a prosecutor at the relatively late age of 33 after failing the now-defunct annual bar exam eight times. His age and penchant for making bold speeches against powerful elites earned him the nickname “Big Brother” among his fellow prosecutors.In 2006, Yoon displayed characteristic bravado in seeking the arrest of Hyundai Motor Chairman Chung Mong-koo -- one of the country’s most powerful corporate titans, who was later convicted and pardoned. Yoon is someone who wouldn’t let a friend get away with wrongdoing, according to the person who has known him for more than 40 years.The investigations into Cho’s family have dealt a blow to Moon’s plans to overhaul a prosecutorial system that long been seen in South Korea as a tool for the country’s political elite to suppress dissent. While Moon had hoped Yoon would help push through legislation to weaken his own office, the chief prosecutor has publicly disagreed with a key part of the plan: delegating more investigative decisions to the police.Shortly after Yoon took office, the welcome note on the Supreme Prosecutors’ website was revised to include a pledge to “always serve the public by sternly holding those who wield power accountable for their abuses and violence.”In remarks that take on new significance in light of Yoon’s subsequent investigations, Moon urged the incoming chief prosecutor in July not to shy away from inquiries involving his own administration.“I want you to be really strict, even should there be influence-peddling and corruption within my office, government or the ruling party,” he told Yoon. “Thankfully, unlike the past, there hasn’t been a big, contemptible corruption case within my office, government or the ruling party yet.”(Adds comment from Cho in seventh paragraph.)&amp;#92;--With assistance from Jihye Lee.To contact the reporter on this story: Kanga Kong in Seoul at kkong50@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Pae at ppae1@bloomberg.net;Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description>

      <title>The Hong Kong Police Gunshot That Unleashed a Day of Mayhem</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/hong-kong-police-gunshot-unleashed-160000850.html"&gt;&lt;img src="" width="130" height="86" alt="The Hong Kong Police Gunshot That Unleashed a Day of Mayhem" align="left" title="The Hong Kong Police Gunshot That Unleashed a Day of Mayhem" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Even before most of Hong Kong got to work Monday, protesters already had a fresh grievance against the police.A traffic cop seeking to break up a rush-hour roadblock grabbed a masked protester in a headlock and shot another in the abdomen at close range. The demonstrator collapsed on the crosswalk as blood pooled under him, prompting speculation that he could be the first to die from police gunfire after five months of unrest. He is in critical condition.The incident -- caught on video and widely circulated on social media -- added new fuel to criticism of police tactics already raging after a student died Friday from injuries suffered near a clash between cops and protesters. Moments later, another police officer was filmed repeatedly driving a motorcycle through a group of retreating protesters, striking several.Activists attempted to use the shooting to rally support for more protests on Tuesday, circulating flyers on social media featuring an image of a revolver and calling on people to disrupt traffic during the morning commute. The University of Hong Kong canceled all classes on Tuesday. Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union urged a suspension of all classes at schools and kindergartens, according to a statement on its Facebook page.Monday’s chaos showed the strains facing Hong Kong’s police, which the China-appointed government has relied on to suppress increasingly violent protests aimed at securing greater democracy. The shooting led protesters to flood the city’s central business district at lunch time -- spurring fresh outrage at police when they fired volleys of tear gas into streets and luxury malls, sending office workers sprinting to safety and to wash out their eyes.“People in Hong Kong are getting more and more angry that the violence from the police is increasing,” said Tommy, 52, an accountant in Hong Kong who was with hundreds gathered in Central on Monday. “They just beat on protesters like terrorists. The most important solution is to have an independent investigation. But our government just doesn’t listen.”Although police said they suspended the motorcycle officer pending an investigation, they defended the officer who discharged his weapon, saying he feared for his safety. Police have repeatedly reaffirmed their commitment to restraint, despite criticism from the United Nations, U.S. and U.K. lawmakers, and Amnesty International, which accused the force of torturing detained protesters. Police have denied that claim.The shooting Monday was the third time a protester has been shot in the past two weeks, although all the victims have survived. The student who died Friday had fallen earlier in the week from a parking garage deck near a clash between protesters and police, making him the first such fatality.Protesters have seized on police tactics to justify their own escalations in a city once known for its non-violent demonstrations. Hard-core activists now show up at protests wearing gas masks and body armor and hurl petrol bombs at police lines.On Monday, a man was set on fire while arguing with one group in the northeastern area of Ma On Shan. He is also in critical condition.“The level of violence used by the rioters has escalated significantly throughout these five months,” senior superintendent Kong Wing-cheung told a news briefing Monday. “I do not agree that our officers are out of control with their use of force, but of course we are under great pressure and our officers also encounter difficult times during our operations.”Worn out by months of protests and trying to contain rallies that often pop up out of nowhere, the police find themselves outnumbered and surrounded. That’s what happened to the traffic officer who opened fire Monday.

      <media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/hong-kong-police-gunshot-unleashed-160000850.html"&gt;&lt;img src="" width="130" height="86" alt="The Hong Kong Police Gunshot That Unleashed a Day of Mayhem" align="left" title="The Hong Kong Police Gunshot That Unleashed a Day of Mayhem" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Even before most of Hong Kong got to work Monday, protesters already had a fresh grievance against the police.A traffic cop seeking to break up a rush-hour roadblock grabbed a masked protester in a headlock and shot another in the abdomen at close range. The demonstrator collapsed on the crosswalk as blood pooled under him, prompting speculation that he could be the first to die from police gunfire after five months of unrest. He is in critical condition.The incident -- caught on video and widely circulated on social media -- added new fuel to criticism of police tactics already raging after a student died Friday from injuries suffered near a clash between cops and protesters. Moments later, another police officer was filmed repeatedly driving a motorcycle through a group of retreating protesters, striking several.Activists attempted to use the shooting to rally support for more protests on Tuesday, circulating flyers on social media featuring an image of a revolver and calling on people to disrupt traffic during the morning commute. The University of Hong Kong canceled all classes on Tuesday. Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union urged a suspension of all classes at schools and kindergartens, according to a statement on its Facebook page.Monday’s chaos showed the strains facing Hong Kong’s police, which the China-appointed government has relied on to suppress increasingly violent protests aimed at securing greater democracy. The shooting led protesters to flood the city’s central business district at lunch time -- spurring fresh outrage at police when they fired volleys of tear gas into streets and luxury malls, sending office workers sprinting to safety and to wash out their eyes.“People in Hong Kong are getting more and more angry that the violence from the police is increasing,” said Tommy, 52, an accountant in Hong Kong who was with hundreds gathered in Central on Monday. “They just beat on protesters like terrorists. The most important solution is to have an independent investigation. But our government just doesn’t listen.”Although police said they suspended the motorcycle officer pending an investigation, they defended the officer who discharged his weapon, saying he feared for his safety. Police have repeatedly reaffirmed their commitment to restraint, despite criticism from the United Nations, U.S. and U.K. lawmakers, and Amnesty International, which accused the force of torturing detained protesters. Police have denied that claim.The shooting Monday was the third time a protester has been shot in the past two weeks, although all the victims have survived. The student who died Friday had fallen earlier in the week from a parking garage deck near a clash between protesters and police, making him the first such fatality.Protesters have seized on police tactics to justify their own escalations in a city once known for its non-violent demonstrations. Hard-core activists now show up at protests wearing gas masks and body armor and hurl petrol bombs at police lines.On Monday, a man was set on fire while arguing with one group in the northeastern area of Ma On Shan. He is also in critical condition.“The level of violence used by the rioters has escalated significantly throughout these five months,” senior superintendent Kong Wing-cheung told a news briefing Monday. “I do not agree that our officers are out of control with their use of force, but of course we are under great pressure and our officers also encounter difficult times during our operations.”Worn out by months of protests and trying to contain rallies that often pop up out of nowhere, the police find themselves outnumbered and surrounded. That’s what happened to the traffic officer who opened fire Monday. While he fired three shots, only one hit a protester.“One of the most dangerous things any police officer can do is move away independently,” said Clifford Stott, a professor at Keele University in the U.K., who was one of the experts on an international panel appointed to advise Hong Kong’s Independent Police Complaints Council on the protests. “It’s highly stressful, they’re highly vulnerable, and in that context we’re likely to see extremely high levels of use of force.”Numerous police officers have been injured since more than one million people flooded Hong Kong’s streets in June for what started out as a largely peaceful movement against legislation that would’ve allowed extraditions to mainland China.

      <title>Police Employees Charged in 911 Medical Fraud Ring</title>

They are accused of being part of a citywide medical insurance fraud ring that sent thousands of car accident victims to specific health clinics, doctors and lawyers in exchange for kickbacks.Law enforcement officials arrested 27 people in connection with the scheme -- 23 of those were expected to appear in Manhattan federal court Thursday.A key component to the scheme were the five 911 operators and an active police officer, Yanaris Deleon, who provided victims&amp;#39; confidential contact information to the scheme&amp;#39;s ringleaders, prosecutors said. Four of the five 911 operators were active employees; one had previously resigned, police said.&amp;quot;There is no place for corruption within the NYPD,&amp;quot; James P. O&amp;#39;Neill, the police commissioner, said in a statement. &amp;quot;By tarnishing the shield, as well as their sacred oaths, these employees will be held to the highest account the law provides.&amp;quot;According to court documents, the 911 operators and Deleon provided victims&amp;#39; contact information to the scheme&amp;#39;s fraudulent &amp;quot;call center.&amp;quot;The call center would then contact those victims and coax them to visit prearranged medical clinics and lawyers, court documents say. Those call center offices would then pay the ringleader of the scheme, Anthony Rose, 51, in exchange for that information, according to authorities.Prosecutors said the department employees received thousands of dollars for their part in the scheme.&amp;quot;These actions have undermined the integrity of our emergency and medical first responders,&amp;quot; said Geoffrey S. Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan. &amp;quot;This office is committed to rooting out corruption wherever it is found and will not rest until those who seek to profit by corrupting our public institutions are brought to justice.&amp;quot;The fraud ring employed a network of people within hospitals, medical service providers and law enforcement. Rose, who is from Queens, ran the scheme from at least 2014 to November 2019, prosecutors said.As recently as June, Deleon texted Rose on encrypted messaging app WhatsApp and provided a list of &amp;quot;nearly two dozen names and telephone numbers&amp;quot; of accident victims, court documents said.Prosecutors estimate that as many as 60,000 car accident victims may have had their confidential information improperly disclosed.Rose ordered his co-conspirators to target car accident victims from low-income neighborhoods because they were more vulnerable, according to court documents. He told his fraudulent call center not to target victims in Manhattan, court documents said, because &amp;quot;those people got attorneys.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;We need all the &amp;#39;hood cases,&amp;quot; Rose told the call center people, according to the documents. &amp;quot;We want all the bad neighborhoods.&amp;quot;In addition to the Police Department sources, Rose also bribed employees at hospitals and medical centers to violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA, and disclose confidential patient information for car accident victims, the documents say.The investigation is continuing, prosecutors said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description>

      <title>Poland Rebukes Netflix After ‘Terrible Mistake’ on Holocaust</title>

The show focuses on John Demjanjuk, a retired Ford Motor Co. auto mechanic who was stripped of his U.S. citizenship and convicted by a German criminal court for aiding in the murder of Jews during the Holocaust.The series showed a map of death camps that said they were located in Poland, using the country’s current borders.The Polish government has repeatedly pushed for commentary on the death camps to label them as being operated by the Nazis in “German-occupied Poland,” because the eastern European nation had no government of its own on its home soil after the invasion of Adolf Hitler’s forces.“Not only is the map incorrect, but it deceives viewers into believing that Poland was responsible for establishing and maintaining these camps,” Morawiecki wrote, saying he believed it was an “unintentional” mistake. “Today, we still owe this truth to the victims of World War II.”Morawiecki enclosed a 1942 map in the letter, which was backed by a comment from the Auschwitz Memorial saying that “more accuracy” should have been expected from the production.(Updates with details of complaint in sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Maciej Martewicz in Warsaw at mmartewicz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Wojciech Moskwa at wmoskwa@bloomberg.net, Michael WinfreyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description>

      <title>Hong Kong police shoot protester as pro-democracy unrest spirals into rare working-hours violence</title>

A 21-year-old activist was in critical condition after being shot and wounded at around 7.20am as traffic police trying to stop protesters from blocking a road fired three live shots with no prior warning. Police later said all were meant to be warning shots, as the officers felt their lives were under threat. Video circulating online showed an officer holding a protester and pointing his gun at another, firing at close range. Another man was admitted to hospital for burns, after he was set on fire. Videos online show protesters arguing with a man in a green t-shirt, as he criticises Hong Kong’s pro-democracy activists. A masked person in black then throws liquid over the man, and sets him on fire. The violence is pushing Hong Kong to the “brink of no return,” said Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam. She condemned the protesters’ “wishful thinking” that escalating violence would force the government to meet their demands.  Police fired tear gas in the Central business district Credit:  REUTERS/Thomas Peter “I’m making this statement clear and loud here: That will not happen,” Ms Lam said. “Violence is not going to give us any solution.”  Chaos erupted as news of the use of live rounds spread, and as video circulated online of a police officer driving his motorcycle into protesters, further inflaming tensions. The police said the officer was suspended and under investigation. Police fired tear gas in several neighbourhoods, as clashes broke out throughout the day, including in the central business district. Subway stations were closed and bus routes halted as activists blocked roads and vandalised stations. Protesters also threw petrol bombs inside a rail car holding passengers, a subway spokesperson told local media.    Protests are now a near-daily occurrence, sometimes flaring up with little or no notice, engulfing city in the biggest political challenge ever against Xi Jinping, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party.  Skirmishes are increasingly violent, with protesters vandalising buildings and throwing petrol bombs and bricks at police, government offices, as well as people or businesses thought to be pro-Beijing or sympathetic to police.  Police have responded with greater force, using tear gas, water cannons, rubber bullets and sponge grenades, making more than 3,000 arrests since protests began early June. The first use of live rounds came in August, when two protesters, aged 14 and 18, were shot, both of whom survived. Some office workers took shelter from the tear gas inside a mall Credit: Nicole Tung/Bloomberg Activists increasingly resent the police for using what they call disproportionate force in handling the protests.  The live rounds on Monday “are clear evidence of reckless use of force,” said Man-kei Tam, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong. “These are not policing measures – these are officers out of control with a mindset of retaliation.” “These behaviours call their training in question and the commands they have been given – officers should be deployed to de-escalate difficult crowd control situations, not make them worse,” said Mr Tam. Underpinning the protests are widespread fears that Hong Kong’s unique freedoms are eroding under Beijing rule. Some protesters have also called for independence, something Chinese Communist Party leaders will never tolerate.  Beijing has decried the protests as the work of Western governments trying to foment unrest to destabilise China, without giving any evidence.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description>

      <title>Imelda Marcos Is Here to Teach Us How Wannabe Autocrats Like Trump Really Think</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/imelda-marcos-teach-us-wannabe-101641057.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SajXteHKGtqz8I49jb88ow--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/056a79bd22dfb4fd620fa7f76b942083" width="130" height="86" alt="Imelda Marcos Is Here to Teach Us How Wannabe Autocrats Like Trump Really Think" align="left" title="Imelda Marcos Is Here to Teach Us How Wannabe Autocrats Like Trump Really Think" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;Artur Widak/NurPhoto via GettyLONDON—At the 80th birthday party of comedian Joey Adams in the ballroom of an upmarket hotel overlooking Central Park in 1991, Donald Trump and Imelda Marcos sat side by side; two vulgar icons of ’80s greed and ambition.Imelda and her husband Ferdinand Marcos had been ousted from power five years earlier by a popular uprising in the Philippines where people had grown sick of their corruption and brutality. Trump was a loud-mouthed but ultimately powerless New York real estate mogul.Fifteen years later, in 2016, Trump was elected President of the United States and Marcos’ political clout was restored after a Filipino presidential election in which her son stood to be vice president and Rodrigo Duterte became the hardline president.The Marcos family are believed to have stolen more than $10 billion from the Filipino people during their 21-year reign. Ferdinand died in 1989, but in recent years, the family secretly helped to fund the rise of Duterte, a notorious homophobe and rape apologist who has bragged of executing drug-dealers in thousands of extrajudicial street killings.Trump is one of the few world leaders to have spoken warmly of Duterte and reportedly congratulated him on his approach to the drug trade.The great claim to fame of vaudevillian Joey Adams’ may be his invention of the one-liner: “With friends like these, who needs enemies?”With friends like his, that’s no wonder.Imelda Marcos, who is now 90, is currently trying to help her son, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., overturn defeat in the 2016 vice-presidential election (after three years, Duterte’s judges are still refusing to reject his appeal). He is likely to run to succeed Duterte when his one-term limit comes to an end in 2022.If Imelda lives to see her son’s election as president, it would be an extraordinary return to power for a woman who was forced into exile as one of the world’s most mocked and disdained leaders, famous for collecting more than a thousand pairs of designer shoes while the angry populace was restrained under martial law.Her second rise has been expertly charted in Kingmaker by documentarian Lauren Greenfield, whose previous work includes the Sundance-feted The Queen of Versailles. Her new film offers a glimpse of the distorted inner monologue of a politician driven by autocratic tendencies.‘The Kingmaker’: A Scathing Portrait of the Female Donald TrumpImelda describes herself as a “mother” to the Philippines and its clear that she genuinely believes her kleptocratic rule blessed the nation. On screen we see her tutting over buildings that have been left to decay in the subsequent decades, while she passes out cash to needy citizens who squabble over the handouts. “I do think she believes her story,” Greenfield told the Daily Beast in London. “And the people around her don’t disabuse her of that. In a way she’s got her own delusions.”Greenfield spent five years filming the documentary, a period that spanned Imelda’s rise from a period as a lowly congresswoman to the rebirth of her power. “As we worked over the five years it became clear that they were coming back to power. And that this wasn’t a story about the past; it was a story about the present,” she said.That transformation was made possible by a change in the perception of the Marcos family, who were chased out of the country in disgrace 30 years ago. An aggressive use of social media as well as campaigning to have schools change the way the history of their reign was taught have helped to reinvent their reputation.“Perceptions are real, the truth is not,” says Imelda in the film.“She’s aware of the power of the media,” explained Greenfield. “She says ‘The gun can kill you only till the grave, and the media can kill you to infinity and beyond.’ And they&amp;#39;ve been very adept at using social media to communicate their talking points about martial law and the Marcos era. That was a really big part of how they seeded a lot of the ideas. Bongbong really went after the younger generation which didn&amp;#39;t really remember martial law.”Thus the Marcos family have succeeded in ingratiating themselves back into polite society and into the hearts of millions of voters.As the film begins, we are swept into Imelda’s attractive and rarefied world. “At first I found her kind and generous, and captivating and funny, and able to laugh at herself in a way that was kind of endearing. And then as I learned of the terrible and tragic consequences of the regime that she was complicit in, my view of her and also her version of history really changed,” Greenfield said.Kingmaker shows us both sides. The film’s brilliance lies in allowing us to see the autocrat’s delusion in still believing they speak for the common man. It’s a familiar theme.“Imelda talks about her friends who other people thought were monsters, but she thought were kind and generous like Saddam Hussein and Chairman Mao. It makes you think of Trump&amp;#39;s bedfellows and who he&amp;#39;s attracted to, like Putin and even Duterte,” said Greenfield.Imelda says Mao kissed her hand and congratulated her personally for ending the Cold War. She also claims to have given him the idea for the Cultural Revolution.By joining forces with Duterte, the Marcos family is emphasizing the continuity with a new generation of strongmen. “Duterte was really the expression of the terror of dictatorship coming back, they were leaning in to what happened and trying to get back there again,” said Greenfield.“It&amp;#39;s a cautionary tale for us about what happens when you don&amp;#39;t remember history; about the fragility of democracy and the return to authoritarian regimes,” the director said. “I didn&amp;#39;t start the movie as just being about the Philippines and I am pleased that people are seeing it as a reflection also of what&amp;#39;s going on in the U.S. and the rise of nationalism in Europe.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

      <title>Democrats need to stop being such babies about Barack Obama</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-stop-being-babies-barack-105002574.html"&gt;&lt;img src="" width="130" height="86" alt="Democrats need to stop being such babies about Barack Obama" align="left" title="Democrats need to stop being such babies about Barack Obama" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pete Buttigieg got in hot water with many loyal Democrats on Sunday when the Los Angeles Times reported that he cited the &amp;quot;failures of the Obama era&amp;quot; as part of why Trump&amp;#39;s election happened. This inspired furious outrage from liberal partisans and party apparatchiks -- only soothed (and tweets deleted) when the reporter said he had misquoted Buttigieg, who was then quick to lavish praise on the ex-president.But as it turns out, Buttigieg previously said almost the exact same thing in a recent interview with Showtime&amp;#39;s The Circus. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s going back to Obama... the American political world we&amp;#39;ve been in from the day I was born, has been blown up,&amp;quot; he explained, &amp;quot;[thanks to] its own failures which culminated in Trump. Look, if the old way worked, something like Trump would never have been possible.&amp;quot;So this recent flap sure looks like another flip-flop from Payola Pete, mayor of Indiana&amp;#39;s fourth largest city. But at least in his beta release form, I have to admit that Buttigieg was completely correct. Democrats really need to get over this worshipful reverence of Barack Obama.For one thing, it is simply beyond question that the Obama years were a political disaster. From having commanding majorities in both the House and the Senate, Democrats lost first the former, then the latter, and finally the presidency, as the candidate running as Obama&amp;#39;s successor bobbled perhaps the easiest lay-up election in American history. Meanwhile, the party all but collapsed in many states, as devastating national defeats translated into the loss of over 1,000 state legislative seats.As I have written before, the primary reason for the Obama-era Democrats&amp;#39; initial crushing loss in 2010, which locked in Republican gains for a decade at least through their ensuing control of the state gerrymandering process, was policy error -- undershooting the size of the economic stimulus in response to the Great Recession on the one hand, and secretly using homeowner assistance money to bail out the banks on the other. The former was not entirely Obama&amp;#39;s fault, as he had to get congressional approval for the stimulus, but the latter was entirely under his control. Millions were left out of work, and about 10 million people losing their homes wreaked further economic devastation. As any historian could tell you, being in power during a huge economic disaster is the surest possible way to get blown out of the water in the next election.If you take Obama out of the equation, what Buttigieg was saying before it looks like folks might stop sending those fat campaign checks is all but conventional wisdom even among liberals. Obama himself reportedly has grave doubts about what Trump means for his legacy. Clearly if the party could lose to the most unpopular major party nominee in the history of polling, whatever was happening before 2016 was not exactly working out.And from the other side of the fence, Obama has shown no inclination to fulfill the sort of leadership role loyal Democrats clearly crave. Despite the shattering national crisis that Trump presents, he has not gone on to a different office -- unlike, say, John Quincy Adams, who returned to the House after his presidency and fought slavery literally until his dying breath. Obama is not out there mobilizing day and night against Trump&amp;#39;s migrant concentration camps, or his Muslim ban, or his blatant abuses of power.Only occasionally will Obama pop up to endorse candidates, often centrist or center-right white men like Emmanuel Macron or Justin Trudeau. He largely avoided campaigning in 2018 until the last few weeks before the election. He&amp;#39;s mainly keeping to himself, hanging out with rich tycoons and celebrities, and making eye-popping sums giving paid speeches before big corporations and banks.He appears in public only occasionally -- and when he does, he has a tendency to indulge in get-off-my-lawn youth scolding that, as Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote back in 2013, was offensive and out of date when he did it as president. &amp;quot;This idea of purity and you&amp;#39;re never compromised and you&amp;#39;re always politically &amp;#39;woke&amp;#39; and all that stuff,&amp;quot; he said at a recent Obama Foundation summit. &amp;quot;You should get over that quickly. The world is messy, there are ambiguities.&amp;quot; Just like the time when &amp;quot;we tortured some folks,&amp;quot; but it was still important to &amp;quot;look forward as opposed to backwards&amp;quot; instead of enforcing the law, I suppose.Jokes aside, this almost beggars belief. President Trump is flagrantly stealing money from the American state, attempting to get foreign countries to gin up political persecutions of Obama&amp;#39;s own vice president, and Obama is out here raising worries about exaggerated nonsense from America&amp;#39;s most dimwitted and gullible columnists, and earning praise from loathsome trolls:&amp;gt; Good for Obama. (Not sarcastic!) https://t.co/cwq5mcDc7V&amp;gt; &amp;gt; -- Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) October 30, 2019Now, let me be clear: All this is, of course, Obama&amp;#39;s complete right as a private citizen. It is, at least for the moment, still a free country. But Democrats should not follow the advice of the Washington Post&amp;#39;s Jennifer Rubin, who argues that &amp;quot;it is unheard of for a party following a two-term president not to run on his achievements,&amp;quot; in part because &amp;quot;Republicans did that with former president Ronald Reagan for 30 years.&amp;quot; She would know, from her previous incarnation as a prolific and absolutely shameless propagandist for Mitt Romney. But the grim fate of the GOP is precisely the problem.We see today what you get when a party loses the ability to think critically about its history, and treats its leaders as infallible saints no matter what they do: Donald Trump.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?
